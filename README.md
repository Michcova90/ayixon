  # Brief Bio
  
  Microbiologist apprentice. Farmer by birth. I have seen the leaf and the stem of the cane, the coffee bean, since it is a white and aromatic flower bud. In biology, the Darwin of Shrewsbury and Cavalier-Smith. The mystery of the species in prokaryotes, its concepts and demarcations would make any biologist happy or miserable.

The best story: "The immortal" (by Borges ...). The best novel: "100 years of solitude" (García Márquez)

The best poem: ... I'm not so crazy to risk that answer; but once I told myself that Whitman in the North and Vallejo in the South. In the movies: Clint Eastwood. In music: EL SON ... the one that comes from Nené Manfugás.

And of course, microbial taxonomy and metabolism of xenobiotics
